FlyerShare! The paperless way to found out about events and stay connected!

FlyerShare is essentially an app which allows it's users to stay connected across universities.
Users will have the ability to stay up-to-date on the latest events.

  - Flyers can be trashed if they don't have any correlation with the user.
  - Also, the closer it is to the date of the flyer, the higher precedence it will be. (It will show towards the top)
  - Flyers can be favorited which will be in it's own list for the user to easily access the flyers that interested them
  - You can also create flyers and direct them towards the university of your choice. 
      - You can even set a date to post the flyer, so you can be on top of time management and go ahead and preset a post.
